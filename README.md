The singleton pattern was used to implement the Damage done in the Damage Manager Script. An instance of the class can be used when a game object is destroyed which would update the damage score. However I was not able to complete the full implementation but the code for the instance creation can be found in the Damage Manager.

I was unable to fully complete the command design pattern.

The flowchart is attached in the repo where the observer pattern can be use to update game UI for damage or player health where the UI Manager Class would observe the Player Class and when the player takes damage and is changed the UI would update also.
